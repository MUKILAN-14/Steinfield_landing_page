# Landing Page Project
Demo Link - 

## DESCRIPTION

A landing page aims to capture
information from contacts in exchange for something of value, such as a
retail offer code or business-to-business (B2B) insights in the form of a
white paper. Landing pages are different from other web pages in that
they don't live in the evergreen navigation of a website. The goal of
landing pages is to get visitors to fill out the lead form. This usually
includes personal and demographic information, such as name, email id,
phone number, location, organization, etc., thereby enabling your
marketing and sales team to collect valuable customer data.

Landing pages help increase your
conversion rates and lower your cost-per-acquisition. The main reason
they're so good at it is that promotional or product-specific landing pages
are focused on a single goal. Landing pages convert more traffic because
they are focused on one goal or call to action by providing information
about a specific offer or item. It has limited navigation, and the simplicity
keeps a visitor focused on the goal rather than being distracted by
multiple links taking them away from the page.

Testing and optimizing the design and layout of your landing page design can have
major impact on your conversion rate.Because a landing pageâ€™s design
and layout is perhaps the first thing that a visitor notices.
